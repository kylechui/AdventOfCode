# AdventOfCode

Here are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)! All my
solutions are written in C++, and expect the input to be passed in as `stdin`.
I'm mainly doing this as an exercise in learning how to write clean, expressive,
and modern code. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open up
an issue!
